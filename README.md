Electrochemistry software electrochemist.com (former Polar and Polarograph) is virtual electrochemist who can analyze and simulate electrochemical experiments.

<ul>
<li>It  <b>simulates</b> 
<ol>
<li>analytically and digitally
<li>voltammetry and chronoamperometry 
<li>on virtually <b>any mechanism</b> 
<li>in 4 models (finite and semi-infinite diffusions, convection and adsorption) 
<li>at over 10 electrode geometries (planar, spherical, semi-spherical, cylindrical, semi-cylindrical, microdisc, thin film,
 and their rotating electrodes) 
<li>by virtually <b>any waveform</b> techniques (e.g. linear sweep, CV, DC, normal pulse, differential pulse, square wave, 
additive square wave, staircase voltammetries, <b>user-defined or imported waveform</b> chronoamperometry and voltammetry). 
<li>
 the effects to change 35 parameters, e.g. charge current, resistance, noise, preconcentration time 
and potential, convection, pH, the reactant and product numbers, etc. 
</ol>
<li>It provides five ways to check accuracy of simulation. 
<li>It calculates over 1000 types of theoretical peak values. 
<li>It separates the <a href=plot.htm>overlapped peaks</a>.
<li>It retrieves electrochemical parameters from experiment by <a href=plot.htm>curve fitting</a>.
</ul>
